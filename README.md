The goal of tacApp is to help you analyze changes in the power sector
between two time periods. The public source code lives in an [R
package](%5Bhere%5D(https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/tacApp)), and
the public application is available
[online](https://twodii.shinyapps.io/tacApp/).

## Usage

-   Go to <https://twodii.shinyapps.io/tacApp/>.
-   Select a parent company and a technology.
-   Click “Apply”.

## Output

-   A summary of the *real* and *virtual* change.
-   A breakdown of changes as a plot.
-   A breakdown of changes as a downloadable table.

A *real* change is an increase or decrease in the production capacity. A
*virtual* change is a change not in the production capacity but in the
ownership of the asset.

## Data

The data is private. You may get it from [Asset
Resolution](https://asset-resolution.com/). If you have access
