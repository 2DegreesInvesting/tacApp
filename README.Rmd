## Power company assessment

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


### Goal

The tacApp application helps you analyze changes in the power sector
between two time periods.

### Inputs and outputs

* You input a dataset, and select a technology and company.

* The application outputs a summary of the _real_ and _virtual_ change, and
shows a breakdown of changes as a plot and as a downloadable table.

A _real_ change is an increase or decrease in the production capacity. A
_virtual_ change is a change not in the production capacity but in the ownership
of the asset.

### Data

The data is private:

* Users may get it from Asset Resolution.
* Developers may get it from
<https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/tacAppPrivateData>.

## Usage
